# robust v0.7-5 (2024-08-17)

-   man/\*.Rd - Correct Rd file(s) with Rd link{} targets missing
    package anchors
-   DESCRIPTION Added <Authors@R> field

# robust v0.7-4 (2024-01-04)

-   R/glmRob.misclass.q: remove is.R() - see mail of Prof. Ripley from
    29.01.2024

# robust v0.7-3 (2023-12-05)

-   src/compatability.c, lmrobmm.f: format string is not a string
    literal (potentially insecure)
-   src/mmprnt.c: format ‘%ld’ changed to ’%d%, see mail of Kurt Hornik
    from 26.11.2023

# robust v0.7-2 (2023-06-22)

-   tests/robust-Ex.Rout.save: Follow up to changes in robustbase 0.99-0
-   src/tmlfor.f: DFLOAT replaced by DBLE

# robust v0.7-1 (2022-07-08)

-   Sfloat and Sint are now deprecated, see mail of Prof Riplay from
    08.07.2022 typedef-s inserted in robust.h

# robust v0.7-0 (2022-02-01)

-   Replace the call to the deprecated function covMest() by a call to
    CovMest() (package ‘rrcov’), which returns an S4 object

-   Code using S.h is converted to use R.h

-   BLAS - Fix for USE\_FC\_LEN\_T becoming the default in 4.2.0 (early
    notification)

# robust v0.6-1 (2021-11-16)

-   Fixed error on Solaris

# robust v0.6-0 (2021-10-24)

-   Fixed an error due to not explicitly including R\_ext/Error.h -
    include this file implicitly in compatibility.c.
-   Fixed: everything related to ‘covfm’ was moved to package fit.models
    (actually I only commented the exports in NAMESPACE and a couple of
    other references. All the code remains duplicated in robust, also
    the RD files)

# robust v0.5-0 (2020-03-08)

-   New submission, maintainer Valentin Todorov
